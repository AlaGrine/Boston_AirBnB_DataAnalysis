## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:

`pandas`
`numpy`
`matplotlib`
`seaborn`
`plotly`
`nltk`
`Wordcloud`
`scikit-learn`

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Throughout this project, I was interested in using Boston Airbnb Open dataset, available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston),
to answer the following questions:

1. How does seasonality affect AirBnB prices in Boston?
2. How does location affect AirBnB prices?
3. What are the most important features to predict AirBnB prices?
4. What is the relationship between reviews and price?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

A notebook presenting the answer the above questions following the CRISP-DM process is available here.
There are also 3 data files in the _boston_data_ folder:

* listings.csv: includes full descriptions and average review scores for 3585 listings.
* reviews.csv: includes 68275 reviews written for 2829 listings from March 2009 to June 2016.
* calendar.csv: daily prices and availability from September 2016 to September 2017

## Results<a name="results"></a>
